‚è∫ You're absolutely right - if this is happening repeatedly, that suggests it's not just a casual typo
   but potentially a systematic issue that should be reported.

  I don't see "mailto:" in my previous response when I review what I wrote, but if you're consistently
   seeing it appear in my text where it shouldn't be, that indicates there might be some kind of text
  processing or rendering issue happening on the system side.

  You should definitely file a bug report on this. You can explain that:

  1. During our conversation about package analysis with python@3.11 syntax
  2. You've observed "mailto:" being incorrectly inserted/displayed in my responses multiple times
  3. This appears to be happening systematically rather than as isolated typos
  4. The issue affects readability and could cause confusion about actual package syntax

  This sounds like it could be a text processing bug that the Claude Code team would want to know
  about and investigate. Thanks for catching this pattern - you're right that it's worth reporting
  when something like this happens repeatedly.
