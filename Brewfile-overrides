# Brewfile-overrides
# 
# This file contains packages that MUST be installed via Homebrew on ALL platforms,
# overriding the normal "prefer native packages" philosophy.
#
# Use cases for overrides:
# - Critical infrastructure packages needed for the dotfiles system itself
# - Packages where Homebrew version has essential features not in native versions
# - Compatibility packages where cross-platform consistency is essential
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep this file minimal. Most packages should follow normal platform preferences.

# Python 3.11 with proper OpenSSL (essential for package analysis system)
# System Python on macOS uses LibreSSL which breaks the Repology API calls
brew "python@3.11"

# Essential Python packages for the package management system
# These ensure the package analysis tools work immediately after Python installation
# Note: These will be installed via pip after python@3.11 is available
# pip install --user toml requests

# Git (ensure consistent version across platforms for dotfiles management)
brew "git"

# Just (command runner) - essential for package management workflows  
brew "just"
