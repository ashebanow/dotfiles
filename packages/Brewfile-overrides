# Brewfile-overrides
# 
# This file contains packages that MUST be installed via Homebrew on ALL platforms,
# overriding the normal "prefer native packages" philosophy.
#
# Use cases for overrides:
# - Critical infrastructure packages needed for the dotfiles system itself
# - Packages where Homebrew version has essential features not in native versions
# - Compatibility packages where cross-platform consistency is essential
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep this file minimal. Most packages should follow normal platform preferences.

# Git (ensure consistent version across platforms for dotfiles management)
brew "git"

# Just (command runner) - essential for package management workflows  
brew "just"
