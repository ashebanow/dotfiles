# Log in to and unlock Bitwarden CLI.

# If you save the returned session key in a BW_SESSION envvar that will unlock
# your Bitwarden vault for the current shell session. Once BW_SESSION has been
# set in one shell session it'll also be inherited by any commands or scripts
# run from that shell session.
#
# Usage (sh/zsh/bash):
#
#     BW_SESSION=$(bw-open <EMAIL>)
#     export BW_SESSION
#
# Usage (fish):
#
#     set -x BW_SESSION (bw-open <EMAIL>)

    # there is a chance that your session key is present but expired.
    # 'bw' get commands will fail in that case.
